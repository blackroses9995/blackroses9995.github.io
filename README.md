Here is the code used to create my personal website that can also be found at marygentile.me. The site was pieced together from different tid-bits of bootstrap to create and elegant and vibrant website to display my portfolio among other things.
Feel free to use my code for your own website, just remember to remove any of my personal details (such as the google analytics tracking and my email for the formspree).
